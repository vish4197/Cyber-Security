Project Title: Vulnerability Scanning Project using Nessus

Project Summary: The aim of this project was to create a comprehensive vulnerability scanning environment at home, leveraging the Nessus vulnerability scanning tool. 
By conducting regular scans on a simulated network, I sought to enhance my skills in identifying security weaknesses and applying remediation measures effectively.

Hands-On Example: To illustrate, I focused on setting up a vulnerability scanning project using the Nessus tool.

Scenario: Vulnerability Assessment of Home Network

Network Discovery: I utilized Nessus to perform network discovery, identifying all active devices and systems within my home network.
Target Selection: I selected specific IP ranges and devices to be scanned, considering both internal and external devices.
Scan Configuration: I configured the Nessus scan to use different scanning profiles, such as full, quick, or credentialed scans, to cover a variety of scenarios.
Vulnerability Scanning: I initiated the scan and allowed Nessus to analyze each target for known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and potential security risks.
Scan Results Analysis: After the scan was complete, I reviewed the generated report to understand the severity of identified vulnerabilities and their potential impact.
Risk Prioritization: I prioritized vulnerabilities based on their CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) scores, considering the potential risks they posed to my network.
Remediation: For identified vulnerabilities, I researched recommended remediation steps and applied them to the affected systems.
Rescan: After implementing remediations, I conducted follow-up scans to verify that the vulnerabilities had been successfully addressed.

Results: Through this hands-on vulnerability scanning project using Nessus, I achieved the following:
Gained practical experience in configuring and using Nessus for vulnerability assessments.
Developed a solid understanding of vulnerability types and their potential impact.
Learned to analyze vulnerability scan reports, prioritize risks, and apply effective remediation strategies.
Improved my ability to proactively secure and harden network devices and systems.
Cultivated skills in continuous monitoring and proactive security measures.

By creating and executing this vulnerability scanning project, I showcased my commitment to enhancing my cybersecurity skills and contributing to a more secure digital environment. 
This project demonstrated my hands-on proficiency with the Nessus tool, as well as my dedication to staying informed about potential vulnerabilities and taking proactive steps to address them.
