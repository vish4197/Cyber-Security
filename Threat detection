Project Title: Home-Based Threat Detection and Prevention Project

Project Summary: The objective of this project was to create a threat detection and prevention environment within the home network. 
By implementing a range of security tools and techniques, I aimed to enhance my skills in identifying and mitigating various cyber threats commonly encountered in real-world scenarios.

Hands-On Example: To demonstrate, I focused on building a threat detection and prevention scenario centered around network-based attacks, specifically targeting the exposure of sensitive data.

Scenario: Unauthorized Access Attempt to Home Network

Network Segmentation: I segmented my home network into different segments, including IoT devices, personal computers, and guest devices. This helped isolate potential threats and control their impact.
Intrusion Detection System (IDS): I set up an open-source IDS like Snort on a dedicated Raspberry Pi within my network. This IDS continuously monitored network traffic for suspicious patterns or signatures associated with common attack techniques.
Honeypot Deployment: I deployed a honeypot system within a separate network segment to lure potential attackers. The honeypot mimicked vulnerable services and recorded any attempts to interact with it.
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM): I configured a SIEM tool, such as ELK Stack, to collect and analyze logs from various network devices and systems. This provided a centralized view of network activities and potential security incidents.
Anomaly Detection: I implemented an anomaly detection solution that monitored network behavior and user activity. Any deviations from established baselines triggered alerts for further investigation.
Firewall and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS): I deployed a firewall and IPS solution to block unauthorized access attempts and malicious traffic. The IPS actively prevented known attack patterns from reaching critical assets.
Vulnerability Scanning: I periodically conducted vulnerability scans using open-source tools like OpenVAS to identify potential weaknesses in my network, systems, and devices.
Continuous Monitoring: I used network monitoring tools like Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic in real-time. This allowed me to identify abnormal patterns and potential threats.
Results: Through this hands-on threat detection and prevention project, I was able to:
Develop a deeper understanding of network-based threats and attack techniques.
Gain practical experience in configuring and managing security tools, including IDS, SIEM, and firewalls.
Identify and respond to simulated threats, enhancing incident response skills.
Implement proactive measures to prevent unauthorized access and data exposure.
Cultivate a security mindset focused on continuous monitoring and improvement.
By simulating and preventing potential threats within a home environment, I demonstrated my commitment to cybersecurity learning and showcased my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios. 
This project not only honed my technical skills but also highlighted my dedication to staying ahead in the ever-evolving field of threat detection and prevention.
