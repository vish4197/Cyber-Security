Project Title: Setting Up Automated Incident Response with Cortex XSOAR

Project Summary: In this project, I proactively undertook the task of learning and implementing Palo Alto Networks' Cortex XSOAR platform within a home environment. 
My primary objective was to amplify my proficiency in automated incident response and security orchestration. 
The project aimed to establish a simulated environment conducive to practicing practical incident handling, playbook creation, and automation techniques for real-world scenarios.

Hands-On Example: To illustrate, one of the key components of the project involved setting up a mock security incident based on a common threat scenario, such as a phishing attack targeting user credentials. 
I initiated this by crafting a fictitious phishing email with a malicious link and distributed it to a test email account. Upon receipt, I triggered an automated incident response within Cortex XSOAR.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the hands-on example:
Create a Phishing Email: Develop a realistic-looking phishing email, complete with an enticing subject line and content. 
Embed a malicious link that directs to a mock phishing page.
Trigger Incident Creation: Configure Cortex XSOAR to monitor incoming emails on a designated mailbox. 
Set up a custom integration to detect and classify emails as potential phishing attempts based on keywords and characteristics.
Incident Enrichment: Once the phishing email is detected, Cortex XSOAR automatically triggers an incident. 
It gathers information from the email, enriching the incident with details like sender, subject, and the URL in question.
Automated Playbook Execution: Design a playbook within Cortex XSOAR that outlines the steps to be taken in response to a potential phishing incident. 
This may involve extracting URL details, conducting a threat analysis, and performing user impact assessment.
Response and Mitigation: Based on the playbook, Cortex XSOAR initiates a series of predefined actions. 
These could include isolating the affected user account, alerting security personnel, and generating a detailed incident report.
Notification and Reporting: Once the automated response is executed, the relevant stakeholders receive notifications regarding the incident. 
A comprehensive report outlining the entire incident lifecycle, from detection to resolution, is generated and shared with the security team.

By simulating such incidents and automating the response process, I gained hands-on experience with Cortex XSOAR's capabilities. 
This practical approach allowed me to sharpen my incident handling skills, develop effective playbooks, and understand how security orchestration can streamline incident response workflows. 
Through this example, I demonstrated my commitment to continuous learning and my ability to translate theoretical knowledge into tangible skills.
